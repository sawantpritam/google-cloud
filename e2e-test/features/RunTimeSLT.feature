Feature:Run-Time SLT Scenario

  @SLT @Run-Time @Sanity
  Scenario: Validate that MTID can be created and updated using CDF_R_SLT_SETTINGS program
    Given Create new MTID on "Automation" SAP
    When Validate that MTID can be Updated using CDF_R_SLT_SETTINGS program

  @SLT @Run-Time @Sanity
  Scenario Outline: Validate that SLT job can be configured for table containing all data types
    Given Create new MTID on "Automation" SAP
    When Validate that MTID can be Updated using CDF_R_SLT_SETTINGS program
    Then Verify that user is able to update table "<table>" to "stop_load" on LTRC
    Given Open CDF replication and initiate pipeline creation
    When Fetche the record count of table : "<table>" from SAP
    Then Delete GCS folder for mass transfer id table "<table>"
    Then Drop target BigQuery table "<table>"
    Then Verify that user is able to update table "<table>" to "<mode>" on LTRC
    When Select SAP SLT as source and fill connection parameters

    Then Wait till SLT pipeline is in running state and no error occurs
    Then Close logs and stop the pipeline
    Then Get Count of no of records transferred from SLT to BigQuery in "<table>"
    Then Validate record count in BQ matches with count in SAP
    Examples:
      | table      | mode        |
      | ZDATA_TYPE | replication |
